## <a name="about"></a>About

MathScan started as a final project for my apprenticeship. I wanted to create an Open Source OCR application for solving simple
mathematical equations (Addition and Subtraction). The project evoled since. The OCR Application is not able to detect handwritten
equations presently. Since finishing the final project I added a calculator with dynamic Math Formular to create or edit detected 
equations.

Before realesing the project to the AppStore, I will add ADT's for solving and add division and multiplication. After adding
ADT's I will include a wiki page to explain how every component works.

Please feel free to contribute to the project to make it even better :)
